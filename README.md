# Connie's Cookhouse website

This is a mock restaurant website for Connie's Cookhouse. 

listing.php is an online order form. Hitting "proceed to checkout" displays the filled out form/selected items. The drop down menus were dynamically populated from a MySQL table. I'm still working on additional functionality on the order form; I want to format the form better, add an order summary that calculates the total including taxes, and send the confirmed order via email.
